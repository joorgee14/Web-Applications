# Web-Applications
Project Grade: 9.25

The main objectives of this course were to:

Understand the fundamental concepts and principles of web development, including the protocols that govern web communication, such as HTTP and TLS.

Gain proficiency in essential client-side technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Work with a server-side framework to develop robust and scalable web applications.

Connect web applications to databases effectively using an object-relational mapping (ORM) system.

Acquire practical experience working with Flask.

The course consisted of two midterm exams, a final project (which is the content of this repository), and a final exam.

For the final project, we were tasked with building a complete Flask web application. In my case, I developed a dating platform with several key features:

User Authentication: Users can securely register and log in to their accounts.

Profile Creation: Authenticated users can create and personalize their dating profiles.

Matchmaking System: Users can like or pass on profiles, and mutual likes result in matches.

Messaging: Matched users can exchange messages within the platform.

Photo Upload: Users can upload profile pictures to make their profiles more engaging.

Responsive Design: The web application is optimized for a smooth experience across a range of devices and screen sizes.
