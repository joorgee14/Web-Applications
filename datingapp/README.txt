ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES:

EVENTS
We created an extra events functionality to create new possibilities to allow users to meet in new ways, where some user can create an event (specifying certain reuqired parameters)
and other users have the possibility to join such event, in order to create accesible and multitudinary ways of getting to know new people.

FLASH MESSAGES
We have different types of flash messages added through the project, so that the webapp notifies the given user when certain actions are taken such as succes (for example when properly login on the web page), warning
(as when some constraints are not met as entering an invalid age), those are its main us and for some other functionalities

JAVA-SCRIPT FUNCTION FOR RESPOND TO PROPOSAL
The function determines whether a specific section of the webpage related to rescheduling, should be shown or hidden based on the current status value selected by the user.

Additionally, we implemented some extra Java functionalities to make our web more dynamic.

USE OF AI:
We started using AI such as the one offered by ChatGPT to get used to working with Jinja, but that was only at first, when we started understaing the concept an idea of using flask and Jinja, we stopped using it for no more than some
punctual consultations about some recurrent errors in our code. We also used it as a help for making the css files, as there are a huge amount of possibilities in this aspect and so we thought that some extra help with options we did
not know would be of much use to make our webpage more visually appealing for users.
Finally, we also took some tips on how to work with the dates(year, month, day) controllers to be used for the date proposals, in order to not be able to propose a date in a past time, as we were finding big difficulties with that.
